# docker-webapp-microservices
This project consists of two Docker containers: one validates input JSON and forwards details to the other, which processes a CSV file and calculates the sum of a specified product. The app is deployed with Docker and Docker Compose, ensuring inter-container communication. Both containers are pushed to DockerHub for testing and deployment.
